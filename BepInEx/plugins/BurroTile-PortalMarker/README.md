Keep track of your portals! This mod marks all portals on the minimap whenever a portal is renamed or used.

This mod allows you to have only a few portals in your base. Whenever you want to teleport to a new destination, just rename your portal to the previously marked pin on the minimap.

It automatically tracks and updates:
- the pin of the renamed portal
- the pins of the origin and the target portal when a teleporter is used
- the pin after destroying a portal
