# Description
This mod was created for you who like to fish and collect trophies, there are 37 species of fish,</br>
7 types of starfish and a nice crab that gives you a lot of stamina for fishing.</br>
Corals will spawn in Meadowns, Plains and the Ocean, fish will be in these corals, the standard</br>
Valheim fishing rod can be used and for each coral located a marker will appear on your map,</br>
so you can go back there and fish again.</br>
Each fish you catch drops its own fish and you can use it to bake or to make your trophy using TheFisherHammer.</br>
This mod was an excellent idea by @Minyassa, hope you like it and have fun.</br>
</br>
Corals only appear on new or upgraded maps</br>
