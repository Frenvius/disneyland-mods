# Description

This mod pulls nearby items from the ground into containers. Optionally, use a hotkey to store items in your inventory
into containers. WardIsLove compatible, HotBar items can be ignored (on by default), Quickslots can be
ignored (`if turned on in the configuration!`).

This is meant to be a small re-write to the OdinsQOL AutoStore feature. Externalized and now standalone.

## 1. Need to know

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`
