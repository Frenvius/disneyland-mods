| 2.0.2     | - Fix Potion criteria<br/> - Fix Equipment category to include more items like it originally should have.<br/>- Add more predefined groups. I added the following  Armor, Equipment, Weapons, Shield, Chest, Legs, Shoulder, Helmet, Utility, Ammo, Arrows, and Bolts.<br/> - A file will now be created next to the dll called PredefinedGroups.txt which will contain all of the current items in the predefined groups (modded and vanilla, populates when you go into a server/world)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 2.0.0     | - `MAJOR VERSION UPDATE`<br/> - Everything about the configuration has changed. Please delete your old config file and boot the game once with this mod installed to get a clean one.<br/> - Move as many of the configuration options that make sense to YAML configuration. Please read the mod page for details on where to find and read the file for how to use. Ask questions if you need to  in my discord. As frequent questions are asked, they will be added to the wiki tab for this mod. Read the FAQ section on the mod page for more details on that. <br/>- If you have used AzuCraftyBoxes in the past, the configuration is pretty much the same! Works the same, just in reverse (because we are storing things!)<br/> - Main difference between this and AzuCraftyBoxes configurations is that the range can be set in the yaml per container.<br/> - `TLDR;` This update breaks shit because it's a major change, if you are using the mod, delete everything (configuration file and dll). Start over. Read the mod page you lazy person...or figure it out on your own if you're not a smoothbrain |
