# Building

Adds a building skill that increases the health of pieces built by you slightly. You can also build higher, the higher your building skill level is.

Reduced the stamina usage of building by 1% per skill level.

Starting at skill level 30, your hammer has 30% reduced durability drain.

Starting at skill level 50, you have a small chance to not spend resources when building (resources for free building pieces will not be returned, if you destroy the building piece).

All of this can be configured.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
