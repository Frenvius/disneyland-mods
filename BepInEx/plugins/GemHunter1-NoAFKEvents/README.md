Have you ever gone to the toilet and returned to your 3* Boar farm overrun with Drakes?
Well, I did... :c

Did your friend forget to log out, stayed at a base, went away for an hour, and got your base destroyed by trolls?
Well, my friend did... :c

This mod prevents random events/raids from happening near AFK players. If a player doesn't move for a specified amount of time he is marked as AFK.
(The event will start if at least one player is not afk)

# Config
You can change the time of how long the player should not be moving until recognized as AFK (default 5min) and the frequency of checking AFK players (default 30s) in the config. 
It's recommended to use Configuration Manager's in-game F1 panel as it is much easier and does not require a restart.
Otherwise it is in Valheim/BepInEx/config/GemHunter1.NoAFKEvents.cfg

# Installation
This mod depends on BepInEx for Valheim.
Use Vortex or you can install the mod manually by copying its .dll file into your Valheim/BepInEx/plugins folder.

# Server compatibility
The mod is server-side as random events are decided on the host. If you want to be safe then have everyone install it, idk.
