# Description
Have you ever been fighting troll and tried to use your bow only to realize you are out of stamina?

Or have you ever gotten jumped by a gang of greydwarfs while mining and not been able to run away?

Well, then this mod is exactly for you!

Attack Stamina sees to fix these issues by introducing a new system that separates running stamina and attacking stamina.

I will try to keep this mod updated, as well as add to it or change it.


# Config Instructions

1. Download Config Inspector.
2. Launch Valheim with Both the inspector and AttackStamina in the plugins folder. 
3. Once in-game press F1.
4. Configure settings in the Attack Stamina Menu.
5. Enjoy with custom or default Settings!
