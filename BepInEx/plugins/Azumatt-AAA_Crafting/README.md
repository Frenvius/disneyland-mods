# AzuAntiArthriticCrafting

### Azu Anti-Arthritic Crafting. Gives you an input field to enter the amount of items you want to craft. Instead of having to click the craft button 100 times or a fancy plus button 5-10 times. Meant to replace mods that still make you click like MultiCraft.


This mod is compatible with [OdinsCraftyBoxes](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/OdinsCraftyBoxes/) and [CraftFromContainers](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/KxEdna/aedenthorn_CraftFromContainer/) by Aedenthorn/Adenthorn's Collaborators. `Note: The CraftFromContainers version that was tested was the reupload on thunderstore.`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

> ## Installation Instructions
