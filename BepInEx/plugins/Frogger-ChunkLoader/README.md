# ChunkLoader

You can build an observation column. The area of one chunk around it will always be active. If you don't know what chunks are, you can press [Shift + E] on the column and the workspace will be highlighted.

It can be useful for breeding animals or farm mobs. You will put a column next to it and you can safely go do anything else, and the wolves will continue to multiply and the mobs will die. You can also configure the column limit per player in the configuration.

The column must be charged like a torch. By default, a thunderstone. In the absence of recharge, the column will turn off and stop working. If desired, in the configuration of the mod, you can remove the need for charging or change the necessary item.

The configuration is synchronized with the server.<br>
