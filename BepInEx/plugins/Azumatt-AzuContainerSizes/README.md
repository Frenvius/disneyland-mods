# Description

## Vanilla and custom container size alteration mod. Individually alter the size of any container in the game (including modded ones).

This mod is another in the iteration of me trying to pull more and more things out of OdinQOL and make them better.


`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`
