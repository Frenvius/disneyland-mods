- Adds a new pickable material called Reeds (grows at the edges of meadows and black forest), which gives Straw that you can use to build thatch walls and thatch roofs.
- Adds a new pickable material called Clay (spawns at the edges of meadows, black forest, swamps, plains and mistlands), you can use it to build clay pieces.
- (NOTE: If adding to an existing world/old world, reeds/clay will only spawn at unexplored maps.)
- Configurable resources spawn data.
- Adds a clay collector which you can build at the new clay pit location. (NOTE: you need to use upgrade world or genloc command in order to spawn the new location on existing world.)
(NOTE: using genloc command may freeze your game so use at your own risk.)
- Configurable clay pits location spawn data. (NOTE: you can only change the biome of the location before the world gets created or before the location gets added to the word.)
- Uses serversync and built-in config watcher.
