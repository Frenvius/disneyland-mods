# Infinity Hammer

Bend the rules of building! Copy any object, make structures indestructible, remove all restrictions, destroy anything and more...

Install on the admin client (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

Install also [Server Devcommands](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Server_devcommands/) to enable key binds and use this on a server (as an admin).

Install also [World Edit Commands](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/World_Edit_Commands/) for terrain tools.
