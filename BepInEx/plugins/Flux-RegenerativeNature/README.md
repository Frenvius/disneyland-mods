This mod contains some configuration that can be used to regenerate the nature from chopped trees and mined ores.

To use this, you will need to also use SpawnThat (linked as dependency).

If you already use your own spawners for SpawnThat, make sure that the used IDs (3000-300x and 4000-400x) don't colide with yours.

Changelog:
1.0.3: with the fixes coming with SpawnThat 0.11.x the spawning of trees and ores is also fixed and proved working well - no mass spawning without respecting distances will happen anymore. Also adjusted altitude settings, since some were out of range.
