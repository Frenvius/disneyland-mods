# Regenerative Nature

This mod contains some configuration that can be used to regenerate the nature from 
chopped trees and mined ores (at least a spawner for tin).

Other ore's spawners you can create yourselves easily using the given spawner and 
modifying it slightly. The names of some prefabs I found in the past for other ores
are contained in the file as comment already.

If you already use your own spawners for SpawnThat, make sure that the used 
IDs (197xx-199xx) don't colide with yours.

## Installationa

For client-side only, just download this mod using TMM/r2modman from Thunderstore. 
This will do all necessary steps to use it out-of-box.

To use this, you will need to also use SpawnThat (linked as dependency).

For manual installation you will need to download the dependencies yourself and put
plugins contents from them into you BepInEx plugins folder and the contents of 
"config" folder of this mod into BepInEx's config folder.

If you want to use this on a server that uses SpawnThat already, the server 
needs to have the config files loaded, too, since it will sync with clients.
