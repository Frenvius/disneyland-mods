# Description

## Mod that adds colorized map information to your minimap. Enemies and player buildings are colored based on your configurations. Ship icons on the map.

Standalone mod from what was once OdinsQOL. **Please note that this mod has not been re-written yet. It's a direct rip
from OdinsQOL. This is one of the laggiest parts of the mod.**

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`
