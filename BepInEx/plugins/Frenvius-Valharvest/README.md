**Discord**: https://discord.gg/JyWawnNDMv

## Installation:

Place the dll in the plugins folder.

The folder *Translations* must be inside the plugins folder along with the dll

This mod is routinely tested on a dedicated server with a great many other mods. To ensure your plants don't disappear, and that food doesn't turn to dust, please put this on the dedicated server as well as ALL clients.
> For plants to grow on the map it is necessary to have the mod installed before generating the world.

You can use the mod [Upgrade World](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Upgrade_World/) to reset zones in a existing world, using the command *zones_reset* to add all new plants to the world.
 
**Note**: this mod requires BoneAppetit, JVL (Jotunn the Valheim Lib), it will not work without it.

**Note**: for now the raised beds do not support the mass plant from Farming mod, don't forget to press the key that disables mass planting before planting in the raised bed

> *sorry about the planting field, I feel the mod took a way out of focus, which would be new plants and food, so I'm removing that functionality and keeping only the bed raised with a little rework on it to reduce conflicts with other mods. If you were using it, sorry, you will lose the plants that were on it :(*
